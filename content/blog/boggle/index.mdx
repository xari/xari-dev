import { App as Boggle } from "xari-boggle"

I recently built a [word game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) app that creates and solves a grid of letters for all possible word combinations on the grid. 

The code for it in on [GitHub](https://github.com/xari/boggle), and you can play the game below.
