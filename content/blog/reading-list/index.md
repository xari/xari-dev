### Fiction

I read the Three-Body trilogy this year, and am currently making my way through the fan-fiction fourth installment by Baoshu.
These books have been profoundly influential in expanding the way that I perceive the scale of the universe.

I'm also working on developing my reading in French by reading books and series in French that I already know and love in English.
So far, I'm finding this to be very effective.

- The Three Body Problem
- The Dark Forest
- Death's End
- La RÃ©demption du Temps
- Ermita: A Filipino Novel

### Non-Fiction

A friend gave me the Edmund Hillary biography for my birthday last year.
I knew very little of him, other than that he and Tenzing Norgay were the first two men on top of Mt. Everest.
It surprised and inspired me to learn that until age 33, he was happy in life tending to the bees on his father's farm.
Despite being rocketed to fame and knighthood literally overnight, he made it his life's mission to help the villages in Nepal by building schools and hospitals with the money he earned from his sponsorships and the influence he gained from his many honors.

On a weekend trip to Zurich and back, another friend and I listened to Bill Gates' "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster" at 1.5 speed.
This book made me optimistic about the future, and it impressed on me the value of patience in investing.
Specifically, the infrastructure that we'll be able to build in 2030 may be far more advanced than we can manage today.
Power plants can be used for easily half a century before any major updates, so in that regard it may make sence to iron-out the latest tech for use in 2030, rather than already breaking ground with what we have today.

My major criticism of it though, is that Bill subscribes to the idea that the personal automobile is central to our way of life, and that this centrality should continue into the future.
I disagree with this whole heartedly, and believe that the personal automobile, and the landscape that it requires, are the cause of many of our social problems.
This car dominance needs to be left in the history books if we want to make society a friendly and accessible place for everyone.

If you liked the Steve Jobs biography, you may also enjoy the Making of Prince of Persia.
It tells the story of an early game developer making his way in 1980s Silicon Valley, and it makes me long for an industry where a software engineer can also be a designer and a product manager.
