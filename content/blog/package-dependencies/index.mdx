title: Analysing D3's Package Dependencies.

import d3Pkg from "./pkg-d3-latest.json"
import { TreeChart, ForceGraphChart, ForceLegend } from "./index.js"

In a recent post, I [queried the NPM Package Registry API](../async-recursion) for data about the D3 package.
I decided to expand on that post slightly with the addition of a [force-directed graph](https://registry.npmjs.org/react/latest) of D3's dependencies.

The benefit of the force-directed graph is that it shows us how packages can be inter-connected.
For example; D3-Array is a dependency of D3, but it's also a dependency of D3-Time, D3-Geo, and D3-Contour.

## The inter-dependencies of D3

  <ForceGraphChart data={{nodes: d3Pkg.nodes, links: d3Pkg.links}} />
  <ForceLegend range={[0, 1, 2, 3]} title="Maximum degrees of separation from the D3 package" />

The legend indicates the maximum number of degrees of separation that a package has from D3.
For example, while D3-Array is a direct dependency of D3, it is also a dependency of D3-Time, D3-Geo, and D3-Contour â€”all of which are direct dependencies of D3 themselves.
Therefor, the maximum degrees of separation of D3-Array from D3 is 2. 

We can view these dependencies in a tree chart, or dendograph, shown below. 

## D3 Dependency Tree

<TreeChart data={d3Pkg.tree} />

I found it helpful to have both the tree view and the force-directed graph to fully-understand the nature of D3's dependencies.
I plan to follow-up on this post with an analysis of a few other packages.
