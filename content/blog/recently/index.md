I'm taking a brief intermission from my musings about functional programming patterns to reflect on three articles that I've been shaing with friends in the past few weeks.

#### [The many gifts of awkward SILENCE](https://jessicahagy.substack.com/p/the-many-gifts-of-awkward-silence)

I came accross [this post](https://jessicahagy.substack.com/p/the-many-gifts-of-awkward-silence) on Hacker News this morning.
While I'm not someone who believes in playing power games with others, I believe that there are things to be gained by learning how to play the game with my own conscience.

When I take a breathe to reflect during an interview or a company meeting, —or even on a date, I'm not trying to outsmart the other person.
I'm trying to understand what I've been asked, an I'm checking it against my own character to avoid responding with something that will betray the limits of my own knowledge, desire, and energy.

If it's possible, I'm also trying to zoom-out to understand the lanscape that we're playing in.
Sometimes questions are framed in a way that suggests that we're hitting balls in a racquetball court, when we're actually out LARPing in a field somewhere, or playing any game where we have a creative influence on the rules and the framing of it.

One benefit of allowing for awkward silence that isn't mentioned in the post is that silence allows other people the opportunity to speak.
This one doesn't have to involve any question at all.
If you don't have something pressing to say when a conversation lulls, just enjoy the moment for a while, and open yourself up to what's on the mind of your friend or colleague.

#### [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/)

Earlier this year I worked on a project using the Clojure language.
This was a first for me, and I was keep to go as functional as my understanding of the paradigm would take me.
After a few weeks of building-out higher-order components and some very efficient list maps for rendering the front-end, my pull requests were rejected.
My senior dev sat me down to explain to me why sometimes less _is_ more, and that might not be a good thing.

It essentially comes down to whether your "clean code" is actually understandable by your entire team.
Sometimes codebases are bloated with repetitive code that makes it hard to follow what's actually going on.
Other times codebases are dense and impossible to decypher, but completely efficient.
As developers, it's up to us to communicate with our teams to make sure that everyone is on the same page if we're trying to implement a new pattern.

Possibly the most important takeaway from ["Goodbye, Clean Code"](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/) is that codebases should away remain reasonably flexible —especially in their early stages of maturity.

#### [The Burnout Society](https://apposition.substack.com/p/the-burnout-society)

Finally we get to the most profound of the readings in this list; the review of a 2010 50-page manifesto by South Korean-born Swiss-German philosopher, Byung-Chul Han.
[The Burnout Society](https://apposition.substack.com/p/the-burnout-society), or _Müdigkeitsgesellschaft_ (exhaustion society) is the most insightful review of Millenial attitudes toward work and aspiration that I've read.

I don't know what it was like to enter the workforce as a baby-boomer, and I don't think that they magically had it "easier" than we do.
If I had to guess, many people back then had to forgoe their own individualism and take jobs as lawyers, doctors, and other traditional professions.
They were rewarded for this with what to us seems to be more material comfort than we can dream of.

But how many of them had traveled outside of their own country by the time they were 24 years old?
None of them could launch their own TV shows without any credentials or experience.
Meanwhile, my YouTube subscriptions consist of one-man shows by people with an idea and a camera, and millions of subscribers before they were 30 years old.

Traditional rewards no longer exist, but the opportunity to launch our careers into the stratosphere is all around us.
But it is still hard to succeed, despite how many examples of success we see around us.

> Our motivations today come from within. Our goals are success and health. Our life is like a project, its worth measured by our accumulation of those things. No longer obedience-subjects, we are **achievement-subjects**. If the rejects of disciplinary society were madmen and criminals, the rejects of achievement society are depressives and losers.

##### Surviaval is the new success.

I think that the solution to Müdigkeit is to re-define success.
I recently listenend to an interview with Jerry Seinfeld, one of my favorite comedians.
In it, he stated that _"surviaval is the new success."_
To me, sucess is staying healthy and connected to family and friends, and spending most of my time either in creative expression or contemplative reflection.
To achieve this, I need to develop and maintain my _negative potency_; the power to not do something.

In the meantime, I will continue to:

- Practice [not trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMTDAHK-tkE&feature=youtu.be).
- Write code that works, in lieu of code that pleases.
- Take time to reflect before I speak.
